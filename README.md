Application Name: Libris

Description:
Libris is a library management application that allows users to interact. Users can search, sort, check out, and return books using their ISBN. In addition to standard operations, Libris supports special functionality for illegal books—these restricted books require a private access code for check-out, and a replacement book is required to complete the process.

To run the application, execute the LibrisApp. Once started, follow the command-line prompts. Remember to enter a valid ISBN which is 10 or 13 digits. The private access code for illegal books is “secret”. Commands can be found in the manual.
