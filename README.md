## Application Name: Libris

### Description:
Libris is a library management application that allows users to interact. Users can search, sort, check out, and return books using their ISBN. In addition to standard operations, Libris supports special functionality for illegal books—these restricted books require a private access code for check-out, and a replacement book is required to complete the process.

To run the application, execute the LibrisApp. Once started, follow the command-line prompts. Remember to enter a valid ISBN which is 10 or 13 digits. The private access code for illegal books is “secret”. Commands can be found in the manual.


### Our features:

At bare minimum, all projects need to have some aspect of the following components:
- Be able to view all items in the collection - in a logical order: The user can view all books in the collection in order by author name. (Default sort)
- Be able to build a list of items from the collection: The user checks out books into their list.
- Be able to save out that list using a file format we covered in the course such as .xml, .json, or .csv.: This list of checked out books will be saved to a CSV file.

As a group of three, the group is expected to implement three additional features in addition to the minimum. The features the group implemented are:
- Be able to search for items in the collection: Searching for books based on input.
- Be able to sort items in the collection: Sorting based on Title and Author when filtering.
- Be able to filter items in the collection: Filter based on category of book, author, title, and ISBN number.
